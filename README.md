# Economic Complexity Comparisons

Requirements:

- Python 3.6 or newer with the following packages
-- Pandas
-- Numpy
-- Scipy
-- Networkx 2.*
-- xarray
-- pyemd (but it's not curcial, it can be commented out from the network_distance library)

Everything can be installed with pip.

- R 4 or newer with the following packages
-- stargazer
-- relaimpo (from https://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/fileadmin/prof/groemp/downloads/relaimpo\_2.2-2.tar.gz, then install.packages("relaimpo_2.2-2.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source");)

Open questions:

Should the Annihilation complexity be iterative?
Does it make any sense to calculate and include in the updates an importer complexity?
